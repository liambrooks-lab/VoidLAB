## ✨ Overview

VoidLAB is a full-stack cloud coding environment designed to feel like a real premium product, not just a code editor running in the browser. It combines a Monaco-powered workspace, multi-file editing, online code execution, inline stdin handling for interactive programs, GitHub publishing, collaboration-ready tools, a built-in AI guide, and a polished high-end interface.

The project is structured as a monorepo and split into:

- a `Next.js` frontend for the complete product interface
- an `Express` API for execution, auth, and integration flows
- shared configuration packages for cleaner and more scalable project organization

---

## 🧭 What Is VoidLAB?

VoidLAB is a browser-based coding application for developers, learners, and builders who want one premium workspace for writing, importing, running, debugging, and managing code online.

At the product level, VoidLAB acts as:

- an online compiler for multiple languages
- a browser IDE with Monaco-powered editing
- a structured execution workspace with inline stdin support
- a developer tool hub with GitHub, collaboration, profile, and AI guidance features

---

## 🩺 Problem It Solves

Most web-based compilers and lightweight online editors break down in the exact places that matter during real use:

- they feel too basic for serious coding workflows
- interactive input handling is clunky or unreliable
- execution output is hard to read
- publishing and collaboration are completely disconnected from the editor
- the product looks functional but not premium

VoidLAB is built to solve that by giving users a cleaner end-to-end workflow:

- write or import code
- run it in one click
- provide stdin inline when required
- get accurate output in a structured console
- continue working with GitHub, collaboration, and AI support inside the same product

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Frontend responsibilities

- onboarding and direct entry experience
- profile and workspace personalization
- file management and editor interactions
- console, output, and terminal presentation
- GitHub publishing UI
- collaboration and AI tool pages
- communication with the backend API

### Backend responsibilities

- exposing execution endpoints
- forwarding execution requests to Judge0 CE
- handling auth and user sessions
- storing users and provider tokens
- returning normalized compiler and runtime output to the frontend
- handling GitHub repository creation and file push flows

### Execution flow

1. User opens VoidLAB.
2. User writes code or imports files into the workspace.
3. User clicks `Run`.
4. If the program expects input, VoidLAB asks for stdin inline in the output area.
5. The backend forwards the execution payload to Judge0 CE.
6. VoidLAB returns normalized output, errors, and status details back to the workspace.
